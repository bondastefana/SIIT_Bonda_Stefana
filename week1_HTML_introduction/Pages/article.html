		<h1>Rules for Autocomplete</h1>

		<p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so
			many
			UIs get it
			wrong. I see this
			frequently enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I'd just write down the set
			of rules they often break.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but here should
			be a
			good reason
			for breaking one of this rules (for example, some of these rules don't apply if a field must be filled with
			a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very
			least sane experinece:</p>
		<br>
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		<ul>
			<li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options must always go
				below the one matching what they typed.</li>
			<li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type "Fr" I want "Fresno" not "San Francisco."
			</li>
			<li>After prefixes matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with sustring matches would
				almost always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in
				the middle.</li>
			<li>If there are no sustring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequece macthing. This is only
				useful in some cases.</li>
			<li>If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate matches. This
				is rarely necessary to provide.</li>
		</ul>
