For this project I have chosen War - Card Game.

*Game Rules:*

There are 2 players, the deck has 52 cards, which are split equally to each player.

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

The Ace is the biggest card in the deck, and Jack = 12, Queen = 13, King = 14.

The winner is the one who has the biggest score after 26 rounds.
